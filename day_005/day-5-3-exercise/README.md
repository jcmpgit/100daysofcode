# Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Hint

1. There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the `range()` function in any of the solutions.
